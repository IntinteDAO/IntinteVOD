{"title":"Tears of Steel","author":"Blender Foundation","description":"The short begins with a view of a rocket lifting off. The camera than pans to a bridge, where Thom (Vanja Rukavina) and Celia (Denise Rebergen) are standing on, arguing. Thom then says to her that both of them need to follow their passions (Thom wants to be \"awesome in space\", and Celia with her robotics). Celia then convinces him to tell her that he is freaked out by her robotic hand. When Thom admits it, the two break up.","hidden":0,"license":"CC BY 3.0","website":"https:\/\/mango.blender.org","rating":5,"genre":[18,19],"enchanted":0,"next_episode":"","previous_episode":""}
