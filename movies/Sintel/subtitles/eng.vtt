This blade has a dark past.

01:51.800 --> 01:55.800
It has shed much innocent blood.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.450
You're a fool for traveling alone,
so completely unprepared.

02:01.750 --> 02:04.800
You're lucky your blood's still flowing.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.300
Thank you.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.000
So...

02:09.400 --> 02:13.800
What brings you to
the land of the gatekeepers?

02:15.000 --> 02:17.500
I'm searching for someone.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.200
Someone very dear?
A kindred spirit?

02:23.400 --> 02:25.000
A dragon.

02:28.850 --> 02:31.750
A dangerous quest for a lone hunter.

02:32.950 --> 02:35.870
I've been alone for
as long as I can remember.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.500
We're almost done. Shhh...

03:30.750 --> 03:33.500
Hey, sit still.

03:48.250 --> 03:52.250
Good night, Scales.

04:10.350 --> 04:13.850
Get him, Scales! Come on!

04:25.250 --> 04:28.250
Scales?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.500
Yeah! Come on!

05:38.750 --> 05:42.000
Scales!

07:25.850 --> 07:27.500
I have failed.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.500
You've only failed to see...

07:37.800 --> 07:40.500
These are dragon lands, Sintel.

07:40.850 --> 07:44.000
You are closer than you know.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.500
Scales!

10:21.600 --> 10:24.000
Scales?

10:26.200 --> 10:29.800
Scales...
