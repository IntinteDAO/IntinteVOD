# Intinte Media VOD

Intinte Media VOD is a project to create a free (like a freedom) "Video on Demand" platform that presents material not covered by copyright, patents, DRM and so on.

What we want to present is a new vision of the environment like "Free Software" created for the distribution of cultural works.

The project was created in PHP using standard Javascript projects. The project does not require a database (so you can install it without any problems by copying files to the appropriate place on the web server).

## To do:

* Support for series. Currently there is no Playlist mechanism
* Displaying information about the movie being played - who created it, what resolutions are supported, how many frames per second, license, etc.
* Page pagination system
* Movie search system
* Decentralised file storage system

# Thank you:

I would like to thank all the organizations that make free movies. It is thanks to you that this project can exist.

I would also like to thank the free software, PHP, Bootstrap, Bootswatch, Plyr and everyone I haven't mentioned, but I should have ;)
